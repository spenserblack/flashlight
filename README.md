# :desktop_computer: :flashlight: Flashlight

This is a tiny website that lets you set its own background. It then remembers the background you set for next time. That's pretty much it.

## Why?

This is quite literally a flashlight for me.

I wanted to use my monitor as a light source so I don't trip over things trying to
find the real light switch. I used to just start a light-themed application as a hack.
This gives me a little more control over the lighting.
